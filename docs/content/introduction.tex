\section{Problem Definition}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most popular today's trend in the IT industry is the cloud and the migration of enterprise workloads from private data centers into public cloud solutions. This direction is not surprising as cloud computing offers a lot of benefits for companies like minimizing operational costs, flexibility, ease of use -- just to mention a few \cite{CLoudComputingStatistics}. The growing pace of enterprise cloud adoption causes, that more and more applications move into the reigns of public cloud providers. It is not uncommon that these cloud based applications support some fundamental aspects of everyday life like online banking, telecommunications, healthcare, so they can be viewed -- without exaggeration -- critical systems that require a certain level of reliability from the underlying infrastructure.

Kubernetes became the de facto standard for managing cloud based systems as it provides a vastly configurable, modular way of deploying and operating distributed, container based applications. However, the high abstraction layer, that Kubernetes brings into the creation and the maintenance of applications causes some earlier well defined concepts such as dependability harder to guarantee and reason about.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item enterprise cloud adoption is growing fast (https://findstack.com/cloud-computing-statistics/)
%	\item lot of critical applications move to the cloud (banking, telco, datastores, software companies, tools) (TODO source)
%	\item many of the cloud base applications can be viewed as critical systems (lot of money at stake, communication at stake - implicitly can cause human harm, \etc)
%	\item \etc
%\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
	\item dependability of cloud based applications should be constantly monitored and guaranteed
	\item achieving highly reliable and robust cloud applications
	\item prepare the cloud application for various kind of failures, anomalies
	\item \etc
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Goals}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
	\item introduce Kubernetes a widely used system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications in the cloud
	\item define a way to measure dependability metrics in Kubernetes based environments
	\item create a sample application on the Kubernetes platform to demonstrate the collection of dependability metrics
	\item investigate the possible alternatives to improve the dependability in different layers of the Kubernetes based deployment/application and implement some of them
	\item create a framework with fault injection capabilities to measure the effects of the above mentioned improvements
	\item present and evaluate the measurement results and summarize the gained experiences
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis structure}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
	\item to make the results and the thinking easier to comprehend, the thesis in the following way
	\item background
	\item sample application - design and implementation - this will be used the demonstrate the features of the test framework
	\item test framework
	\item enhancements - alternatives to improve the dependability of the sample application
\end{itemize}
